        <li><strong>Meat:</strong>This super meaty lasagna has sweet italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion and Garlic:</strong>An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor</li>

        <li><strong>Spices and seasonings</strong>This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong>Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheeses:</strong>Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
